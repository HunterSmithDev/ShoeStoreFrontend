Shoe Store Demo

Link to site: [[https://shoe-store-frontend-nt4l.vercel.app/]]

This is a project I built in a weekend to show my speed and capability to develop websites. 
The frontend is NextJs/React with TailwindCSS. 
It has a backend api developeed with Python/Flask that delivers the products when on the /products page.

This website isn't perfect but it has the core logic of an ecommerce site. except the checkout peice. 
I will continue to update this website in the future to add new functionality like checking out. ofcourse without a real transactions.
